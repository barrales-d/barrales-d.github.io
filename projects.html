        Hello my name is <em>Diego Barrales</em> and these are some projects that I have been working on to help me
        understand
        code, operating systems, programming languages, and other related programs.

  <!-- ALGORITHMS: BUBBLE SORT -->
  <center class="par_content" style="float:left;">
    <h3>Algorithms: Bubble Sort</h3>
    <p style="padding:20px; text-align: left;">&emsp;Bubble sort was a simple sorting algorithms to learn and code. It
      required 3
      methods to
      implement which were easy to writing into a bubble sort class. In addition, I had to come up with an algorithms to
      randomly create unsorted arrays of ints for the bubble sort class to sort. The way this works is it creates an
      array of a max size of 1000, and inputs random integers between -1000 to 1000 into it. After that you intialize a
      BubbleSort object with that unsorted list of ints, and call the sort function.</p>

  <!-- BANK RECORD SYSTEM -->
  <center class="par_content" style="float: right;">
    <h3>Barrales Banking Record System</h3>
    <p style="padding:20px;text-align: left;">&emsp;This Bank Record system was created to help me learn more about
      Windows file system and how c++ handles file management. I thought about how I should record information that
      changes during runtime. I figured that the best way to go about it would be to treat the file like an api request.
      What I mean is that I would retrieve data from the file and put it into a data structure. This way during runtime
      I could make changes to the data from within the data structures. And finally record those changes by writing to
      the file at the end of the objects lifetime. So the best way was to write a constructor to read in data from a
      file, and a deconstructor to write data to a file. </p>

  <!-- ITRAVEL APP -->
  <center class="par_content" style="float: left;">
    <h3>iTravel App</h3>
    <p style="padding:20px;text-align: left;">&emsp;During the 2022 Spring Semster, I enrolled into a Swift programming
      langauge
      course(CPSC 223W). In which we learn Swift and worked on an app as our semster long project. This project is
      trying
      to create an application that can help travelers be stress-free, allow travelers to focus more on enjoying their
      traveling experience, rather than being stressed out over paperwork and passports, and allowing travelers to have
      all of their information in one application. This project was the first time I really worked with a team to create
      a well rounded app with many features. My sections of the app were the main page and seat map tab. I also worked
      on the backend of the app by creating a database of information about airplanes and airlines and more. So, many of
      backend files were also written by me for my team to utilize.</p>

  <!-- THIS WEBSITE -->
  <center class="par_content" style="float: right;">
    <h3>This Website: barrales-d.github.io</h3>
    <p style="padding:20px;text-align: left;">&emsp;This website was a project in which I got to learn HTML, CSS, and
      JAVASCRIPT. My IDE of choice was replit because it allowed me to see my changes as I saved my work. In addition, I
      got to learn about github pages and how to deploy my own website to share with others.</p>
